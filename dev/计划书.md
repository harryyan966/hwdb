## Determine what is less important but serves as the infrastructure of the application
- admin: create user [x]
- admin: delete user [x]
- admin: update user [x]

## Determine what are peripheral needs that could be postponed
- user: change profile image []
- sort assignments []
- sort students []
- user: update name [1]
- user: update password [2]
- cache theme and language [x]

## Redesign database to avoid nested objects.

## Remove useless score data after deleting assignments and students

## Make Every course contain a non-removable participation, midterm, and final exam. Make courses without sufficient data unable to calculate final scores.

## Calculate midterm scores when publishing them

## Ensure validation is validation - ensure workflow

## Stipulate how to throw exceptions.

## Try converting every enum input back to their enums.

## Add pulldown refresh to every list

## DO NOT BE OBSESSED WITH CONSTS

## Improve client error messages

## THE STICKY TABLE TITLE AND CONTENT MAY GO OUT OF SYNC

## Divide more clearly between the uses of page, view, and individual widgets

## scoreboard arrow up down left right cannot work, focus is always elsewhere
- do not directly unfocus, this will make focus go to things like the appbar

## Only show courses of current year and semester in course search page

## Search by year and semester in admin course page
