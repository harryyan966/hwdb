# hw_dashboard

A school service platform built by and used by students.

if you want to contribute, jump right [here](#coding-philosophy).

## Why?

HWDB provides a easy-to-use platform for students to develop school online services for four reasons.

1. It's good for our community

2. It boosts contributors' college application and gives them more stories to tell.

3. It trains programming skills.

4. In-school contribution is guided by our club.

## Coding philosophy

choose the **EASIEST**, **SIMPLEST**, **MOST STUPID**, and **MOST VANILLA** way

switch to the "clean", "scalable", "abstract", and "semantic" way ONLY IF the above way becomes **NOT EASY** to implement and modify.

> when planning a refactor, you can take notes on [checklists.md](dev/checklists.md) on why

learn from examples. sometimes code can simply be copy-pasted and tweaked to achieve new functionalities.

don't get trapped by performance optimizations in the early stages, fix them later if issues arise.
