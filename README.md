# hw_dashboard

A school service platform built by HW students.

## Why?

HWDB provides a easy-to-use platform for students to develop school online services. It could improve students' daily life, college applications, and programming skills. 

## Coding philosophy

choose the **EASIEST**, **SIMPLEST**, **MOST STUPID**, and **MOST VANILLA** way

switch to the "clean", "scalable", "abstract", and "semantic" way ONLY IF the above way becomes **NOT EASY** to implement and modify.

> when planning a refactor, you can take notes on [checklists.md](dev/checklists.md) on why

learn from examples. sometimes code can simply be copy-pasted and tweaked to achieve new functionalities.

don't get trapped by performance optimizations in the early stages, fix them later if issues arise.
